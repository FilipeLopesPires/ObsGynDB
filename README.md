## Description

This project allows the deployment of a clinical system to manage consultations for obstetrics and gynaecology.
It was developed alongside with professional doctors of the field in order to follow a user-centered design and ensure their most important needs were fulfilled.
Given the nature of the data, measures are also applied in order to ensure the integrity of the information at all times.

Persistence is done using a Microsoft SQL Server Database and the user interface consists of a desktop application designed with Microsoft Forms.
This project has a strong component of planning, with its reports presenting the several diagrams and studies conducted prior to implementation.
